==========================================================

Agenda

OpenResty
----

- OpenResty effectively turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server

-- full-fledged web application server 

-- bundling the standard Nginx core

-- lots of 3rd-party Nginx modules


Web Developer's view
----

- scripting web application server

-- the Lua programming language to script

-- control various nginx C modules and Lua modules

-- construct extremely high-performance web applications 

-- capable to handle 10K+ connections


Architecture
-----

- Runs server-side web app completely in the Nginx server

- leveraging Nginx's event model to do non-blocking I/O

--  not only with the HTTP clients

--  also with remote backends like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Memcached, and Redis.
